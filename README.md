# **HACKTIV8 Talent Fair Challenge**

## Introduction
These project are part of Hacktiv8 Talent Fair Challenge. The project are separated in two parts according to the company proposed problem with the dataset.



## Kalbe Product Sales Forecasting

This project are done to solve the product sales problem in Kalbe dataset. I'm going to analyze the product sales performance with average sales metric and build a machine learning forecasting algorithm using SARIMAX to forecast 14 days of sales. The result of the forecasting are good for product A1 and A2 with low MAE score. But forecasting for product B1 and B2 needs to be improved.

Tech stack : Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Scipy, Scikit-Learn

## Aria Target Growth Regression

This project are to asnwer the product development problem from Aria dataset. In this project I'm going to analyze the correlation between 8 nutient component and target growth to see their relationship. I will also create a machine learning regression algorithm to predict target growth using nutrient data as variable feature. The result of the prediction are quite good with low MAE and RSME score close to zero.
